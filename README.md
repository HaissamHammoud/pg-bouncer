# pg-bouncer
A example of pg bouncer image that can access aws secrets and conect to postgres database

I'll add a funtion that allow you not to get the secret from aws 
But for now only aws secrets is possible

Next step is to add more configuration options.

This image is not ready to be used in production, it can be used only as a referÃªnce.
